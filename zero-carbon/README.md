# Zero carbon infrastructure

This list is a collection of providers (VPS, hosting, email, etc.) that run their business on renewable energy and have a commitment towards the environment.

This list focuses on **zero carbon** providers, not on carbon neutral ones.

## VPS and hosting

### datacenterlight.ch

[datacenterlight.ch](https://datacenterlight.ch/) is located in Switzerland. They operate with 99.9% hydropower from the Alps and a 0.01% from solar energy. They claim also to reuse existing factory halls instead of building everything new. They have been mentioned by [Julian Oliver](http://twitter.com/julian0liver) in his talk [Server Infrastructure for Global Rebellion](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11008-server_infrastructure_for_global_rebellion).

From their [renewable energy page](https://datacenterlight.ch/en-us/cms/hydropower/):

> Not every data center has an in-house hydropower plant, but we do. Data Center Light runs with 99.9%\* hydropower. Few meters away from where our servers are running, the hydropower plant is generating electricity in the basement. We assure you that our electricity is made of 100% renewable energy.
>
> \*0.1 % of electricity comes from solar power.


### greenhost.net

[greenhost.net](https://greenhost.net/) is a Dutch provider powered by 100% Dutch wind energy.

From their [sustainability page](https://greenhost.net/sustainable/):

> Green and sustainable web hosting, from small, simple websites to complex setups with multiple VPSs, is the foundation of Greenhost. We have been front runners in this field for over fifteen years, and we still strive towards maximal sustainability in every step of our production process. This goes just as much for the small choices, like which coffee or furniture to use and for the big contributions, like which hardware or energy supplier to select. This page provides more background information on policy and the choices made.

### FlokiNET

[FlokiNET](https://flokinet.is/) is an Icelandic provider located also in Romania and Finland. They provide a safe harbor for freedom of speech, free press and whistleblower projects.

From their [ecological responsibility page](https://flokinet.is/ecoresponsability.php):

> Iceland´s geographic location provides plenty of both water and wind used to generate energy, from either hydroelectric dams (for further information, see the website for Landsvirkjun, Iceland´s National Energy Company, www.landsvirkjun.com) or, in super-heated form as steam in geothermal power plants, such as the one pictured above (see Reykjavik Energy website, https://www.or.is/English). The second one, wind, provides a steady supply of natural cooling and helps to keep temperatures down.

> This temperate climate is the ideal for data centers. The energy is clean, and renewable. Pollution from energy production is non-existent and the carbon footprint is absolutely zero.
Natural free cooling, amply provided by Kári (an Icelandic nick name for the wind), is used to control temperatures inside the data center, and helps to keep costs down. The average temperature at the data center location is 1.8°C in January and 10°C in July.

### 1984

[1984](https://www.1984.is/) is an Icelandic provider established in 2006. They care about civil rights and Free Software.

From their [about page](https://www.1984.is/about/):

> Green, sustainable geothermal and hydro power energy. 1984 commits to environmentally responsible business practices by utilizing only electricity from renewable energy sources and placing emphasis on reaching the highest possible energy utilization efficiency levels. This is achievable in Iceland, because all electricity production meets the aforementioned criteria and the cold climate makes PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) very high, meaning that for each watt used to run servers, storage and network equipment, proportionally very little is used for cooling, lighting and other overhead.


### Hetzner

[hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com/) is a German hosting provider and data center operator, established in 1997. It has data centers in Germany and Finland, and they claim to have 0 CO₂ emissions by running on 100% green electricity.

From their [environmental protection page](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/umweltschutz/):

> Hetzner Online is taking responsibility and protecting the environment.
>
> Taking responsibility for the environment means there is an increasing need to obtain energy from renewable sources. Hetzner Online uses energy from renewable sources to power the servers in its data centers.

### Bahnhof

[bahnhof.net](https://www.bahnhof.net/) is a Swedish provider focusing on extreme security and low cost green energy.

They started an intiative called [Triple Green](http://triplegreen.net/) that states:

> Triple Green is an environmental certification for data centers which fulfill a tough set of requirements on renewable energy and efficiency. The initiative was started by Bahnhof AB.
> 1. The data center must be powered by renewable energy only.
> 2. Heat from the servers is collected and used for heating of nearby households.
> 3. The household heating replaces other energy sources, and everyone profits in the process.

### greengeeks.com

[greengeeks](https://www.greengeeks.com/) is a US (California) provider. They claim that a GreenGeeks account has a positive energy footprint on the environment as they replace, with wind power credits, 3 times the amount of energy your website will use.

From their [platform page](https://www.greengeeks.com/platform):

> Our hosting platform has been designed with a maximum use, no waste of resources mindset. Every aspect of our hosting platform is built to be as energy efficient as possible.
> In addition to this, for every amperage we pull from the grid, we invest 3 times that in the form of renewable energy via Bonneville Environmental Foundation.
> Your website will be "carbon-reducing" when hosted on our platform. You can feel good that you're helping make a difference by hosting on a platform that is eco-friendly.

## E-mail

### mailbox.org

[mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en/) is a company based Berlin, Germany, that runs on 100% green energy. They claim that their servers are energy-efficient and powered by eco-friendly energy. I'm a mailbox user and I'm quite satisfied.

From their [sustainability page](https://mailbox.org/en/company):

> Our servers are energy-efficient and powered by eco-friendly energy that provided through the data centers. We use renewable energy in our offices, too, provided by the company "Lichtblick".
> Whenever we need to go visit one of the data centers we use public transport or car-sharing offers by Stadtmobil. Should a flight be necessary, we compensate the extra emissions caused with a contribution to atmosfair.


### posteo.de
